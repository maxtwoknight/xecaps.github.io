                    I've worked at an engineering firm for 20+ years now developing software for engineers
                    and designers to use in their day to day work. I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering
                    Technology and fell into development via getting into things I shouldn't have. Since 
                    then, I've gone deeper down the rabbit hole as the years have gone by.

                            I've tried to clean up some bad practices that we inherited, but it has been a
                            slow process. I have a couple of projects that use Entity Framework in a very
                            limited way. I did use Dapper in a recent project that I built and was pleasantly
                            surprised at how simple it was to get up and running.

                            Recently we have introduced a couple of simple API projects to our process

                            pretty basic crud processes hosted internally.

                            I was doing involving 3D modeling we use at work.

                            I am and have always been a huge Star Wars fan. I grew up pretending to be Luke
                            Skywalker and Han Solo. I've been overjoyed at seeing the new series that are
                            being developed. Mandalorian has been awesome and can't wait for more. 
                            Maybe even have to add to my Yoda/Grogu shelf. Really looking forward to 
                            the coming years with some of the content that has been promised. The 
                            Rogue Squadron movie is going to be awesome.

                            I also love reading. I own most of the Star Wars extended universe novels
                            (now legends), which sadly are no longer cannon. However, my favorite 
                            author right now is Brandon Sanderson. His books are amazing. Mistborn 
                            series hooked me pretty quick but Stormlight Archive took a bit longer 
                            to get into. I had to come back to the first book after some time off. 
                            Once I did get into it, I couldn't put it down and read the next two books
                            rather quick and re-read the series before the 4th one came out. And of 
                            course no section about books can skip mentioning Harry Potter. Another
                            series that I have read multiple times now.
